# Kubernetes Cluster Demo

This is tool I created to play with K8s clusters on my MacOS using Vagrant and Virtual Box. 

I started from the [following project](https://github.com/ecomm-integration-ballerina/kubernetes-cluster/) that I fixed to work with K8s 1.6 API. I reworked the code to have the setup on more than one script instead of on one big Vagrantfile hard to read.
